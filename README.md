- Age: Older age groups (50-70 years) have a higher prevalence of CHD.
- Hypertension and Blood Pressure: High blood pressure is strongly correlated with hypertension, which in turn is a risk factor for CHD.
- Outliers: Certain attributes have outliers that need to be handled during preprocessing.
### 5. Data Preprocessing
This section involves preparing the data for model building. Key steps include:
#### Handling Missing Values :
Identify Missing Values: Use isnull() and sum() functions to identify missing values in the dataset.
#### Imputation: Missing values are imputed using appropriate strategies:
- For numerical attributes, missing values are filled using the mean or median of the respective column.
- For categorical attributes, missing values are filled using the mode of the respective column.
#### Encoding Categorical Variables :
- Label Encoding: Converts categorical text data into numerical data. For example, 'Male' and 'Female' are encoded as 0 and 1 respectively.
- One-Hot Encoding: Creates binary columns for each category in a categorical feature. This is useful for features with more than two categories.
#### Scaling Numerical Features :
Normalization: Rescales the numerical attributes to a standard range (typically 0 to 1). This ensures that all features contribute equally to the model. Techniques such as Min-Max scaling or StandardScaler from scikit-learn are used.
### 6. Model Building Implementation
#### Data Splitting
Before training the models, we need to split the dataset into training and testing sets. This ensures that we can evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. The train_test_split function from scikit-learn is used for this purpose.

#### 1. Logistic Regression
Overview: Logistic Regression is a linear model used for binary classification. It predicts the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.

##### Implementation:
- Initialization: Import the LogisticRegression class from scikit-learn.
- Training: Fit the model on the training data using the fit() method.
- Prediction: Use the predict() method to make predictions on the test data.
- Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
#### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Overview: KNN is a non-parametric method that classifies a data point based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors.
###### Implementation:
- Initialization: Import the KNeighborsClassifier class from scikit-learn.
- Training: Fit the model on the training data using the fit() method.
- Prediction: Use the predict() method to classify the test data.
- Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
#### 3. Decision Tree
Overview: Decision Trees split the data into branches based on feature values to make predictions. Each internal node represents a test, each branch represents an outcome, and each leaf node represents a class label.
##### Implementation:
- Initialization: Import the DecisionTreeClassifier class from scikit-learn.
- Training: Fit the model on the training data using the fit() method.
- Prediction: Use the predict() method to make predictions on the test data.
- Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
#### - 4. Random Forest
Overview: Random Forest is an ensemble method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges their predictions to improve accuracy and control over-fitting.
##### Implementation:
- Initialization: Import the RandomForestClassifier class from scikit-learn.
- Training: Fit the model on the training data using the fit() method.
- Prediction: Use the predict() method to classify the test data.
- Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
### 7. Model Evaluation
After training machine learning models, it's crucial to evaluate their performance using various metrics. These metrics help us understand how well the model is performing and whether it's suitable for the task at hand.
- Logistic Regression (Original): Precision = 0.70, Recall = 0.04,Accuracy = 83% Confusion Matrix: [[792 3] [155 7]]
- K-Nearest Neighbors (Original): Precision = 0.28, Recall = 0.05,Accuracy = 81% Confusion Matrix: [[774 21] [154 8]]
- Decision Tree (Original): Precision = 0.26, Recall = 0.24,Acuracy = 75% Confusion Matrix: [[682 113] [123 39]]
- Random Forest (Original): Precision = 1.0, Recall = 0.14,Accuracy = 83% Confusion Matrix: [[793 2] [157 5]]
These results indicate that the models have higher precision but lower recall, meaning they are making fewer false positives but missing more positive instances.So, we need to balance dataset to improve the recall.
### 8. Handling Imbalanced Dataset with SMOTE
Techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) are used to address class imbalance. The impact of these techniques on model performance is assessed. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is an oversampling method used to balance class distribution in datasets. It works by generating synthetic samples for the minority class by interpolating between existing minority class samples.
- Steps to Use SMOTE
- Install and Import SMOTE: Install the imbalanced-learn library if not already installed, and import SMOTE.
- Apply SMOTE: Use SMOTE to create a balanced dataset by oversampling the minority class.
- Train and Evaluate Models: Train the models on both the original and balanced datasets and compare their 
  performance.
- Logistic Regression (Balanced): Precision = 0.32, Recall = 0.49, Accuracy = 73% Confusion Matrix: [[625 170] [ 82 80]]
- K-Nearest Neighbors (Balanced): Precision = 0.23, Recall = 0.51, Accuracy = 62% Confusion Matrix: [[519 276] [ 80 82]]
- Decision Tree (Balanced): Precision = 0.25, Recall = 0.37,Accuracy = 70% Confusion Matrix: [[616 179] [ 102 60]]
- Random Forest (Balanced): Precision = 0.86, Recall = 0.93,Accuracy = 72% Confusion Matrix: [[616 179] [ 85 77]]
- After Balancing (Using SMOTE):
Models show improved recall at the expense of precision, meaning they can identify more positive instances but also produce more false positives. Random Forest continues to perform well with a good balance between precision and recall, indicating it is robust to the effects of balancing. Logistic Regression and Decision Tree also show improved recall, indicating their enhanced
ability to detect positive cases after balancing.

### Results
The Random Forest model showed the best performance with an accuracy of 72% and a recall of 93% for predicting the risk of CHD. Applying SMOTE improved the recall for minority classes across various models.
