# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction
## Project Overview
This project is part of an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The primary goal is to predict whether a patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) using various demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors. The dataset consists of over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.
## Dataset
The dataset contains the following attributes:
- Age
- Sex
- Education
- Current Smoker
- Cigarettes Per Day
- BP Meds
- Prevalent Stroke
- Prevalent Hypertension
- Diabetes
- Total Cholesterol
- Systolic BP
- Diastolic BP
- BMI
- Heart Rate
- Glucose
## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key sections:
### 1. Problem Statement
This section provides a clear definition of the problem, outlining the objectives of the project. The goal is to predict the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) using a variety of patient attributes.
### 2. Importing Libraries
In this section, all necessary libraries are imported. These include:
- 'pandas' and 'numpy' for data manipulation and analysis.
- 'scikit-learn' for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- 'matplotlib' and 'seaborn' for data visualization.
- 'warnings' to ignore warnings for cleaner outputs.
